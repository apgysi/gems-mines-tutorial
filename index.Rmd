# Prerequisites {-#prerequisites}

 GEM-Selektor (GEMS), is a numerical modeling program with a graphical user interface based on Gibbs energy minimization and permits calculating and solving fluid-rock interaction problems of interest in geochemistry. 
 
- Installation instructions for GEMS and more information about this modeling program can be found on the GEMS team webpage: http://gems.web.psi.ch/GEMS3/techinfo.html. 

- Information about the MINES database and project files for the tutorials can be found under https://geoinfo.nmt.edu/mines-tdb
